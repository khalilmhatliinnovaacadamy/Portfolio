    <div><h3 class="colorhtml">HTML</h3>
    <P>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. ... HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</P>
    </div>
    <div> <h3 class="colorcss">CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="colorjavascript">JAVASCRIPT</h3>
        <p>JavaScript(often shortened to JS)is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. ... catch blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly so)</p>
